TL;DR:
I Write Software.

Hi, I'm *[Hamza Zafar](https://hamzafer.me/)*. I am a Senior Software Engineer and a Team Lead at a Startup. I love coding and am passionate about new technologies such as web frameworks, machine learning, and cloud computing.

I graduated from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences in 2020 with a Silver Medal. My final year project was a mobile app to help visually impaired people using machine learning algorithms. My work experience started right after my 4th semester as an undergraduate when I completed my internship and learned to write code in Python. After learning the skills to work in industry, I got attached to a startup in the United States remotely, where I developed websites and worked on neural networks in forex trading. 

After graduation, I joined a multinational company and started working full-time as a software engineer. I worked there for a couple of years for their client, Marks & Spencer, and received great appreciation from the client and the company. I enjoyed my time adding value for the millions of users using our developed software, generating revenue of around a billion dollars. The culture was great, and the people there were like a family (I miss you all :'), but working in an enterprise can sometimes be tedious. Hence, I decided to join a fast-paced startup where any store can get their fully functional apps (Mobile & Website) in 5 minutes. This environment helped me to grow tremendously, both technically and professionally.

Meanwhile, I already had started finding freelance work to keep me dynamic and utilize my full potential. My projects mainly relate to the web, cloud, and machine learning solutions. I got to work with hundreds of clients worldwide, which opened up my vision beyond any horizon.

I like to interact and socialize with like-minded people. Being a medalist and teacher assistant, I have many connections across academia and professional workspaces, which helps me to inspire people around me. I always seek to add value wherever I go and implement solutions to complex problems.


I love anime and music. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihamzafer/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mughal.hamzazafer/)
